# FPGA Network Packet Analyzer

## Project Description

This project implements a real-time network packet analyzer on FPGA hardware. The system receives network packets via UART, parses packet headers, detects errors, and performs neural network-based classification. The analyzer provides detailed packet information through a Python GUI interface, enabling efficient network monitoring and analysis for embedded systems applications.
